In Designing Intelligence Augmentation Group (DIAG), we do research on the intersection of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/march-april-2013/teaching-and-learning-human-computer-interaction) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf). We explore how people and AI can work together in smarter ways. By combining the strengths of human insight and machine intelligence, we create systems that help solve real-world problems from social challenges to complex technologies. Our work blends computer science with social science to design human-AI collaborations that achieve what neither people nor machines could do alone.

DIAG is currently a hybrid lab, with members working remotely or in person from Incheon and Hyunpoong, fostering cross-location collaboration.<br/><br/><br/>

    Our lab name <img src="/diag_logo.png" alt="Logo" style={{ width: "120px", verticalAlign: "middle", marginRight: "4px" }} /> [dī-ˈa-g] draws inspiration from multiple domains. In linear algebra, diagonal elements often carry key structural properties of a matrix, just as our lab brings together key people to tackle critical research topics. In programming, the <strong>`diag`</strong> function extracts these essential components, reflecting our focus on identifying what matters most in human-AI collaborative design. DIAG is also a nod to the University of Michigan's iconic open space at the Central Campus, known for its role as a gathering place for students and intellectual exchange. Likewise, our lab serves as a hub for collaborative, interdisciplinary research on hybrid intelligence systems.

### Research Goals and Lab Logistics

Our lab is dedicated to cultivating independent researchers through supporting students in developing the critical thinking, methodological rigor, and communication skills necessary for high-impact research. Specifically, we aim to help students:

- Formulate research problems and questions

- Understand state-of-the-art AI techniques

- Design rigorous studies and prototypes

- Conduct and interpret data analysis

- Communicate research effectively<br/>

We hold weekly lab meetings that include lightning updates, informal paper discussions, and research progress presentations to foster continuous learning and collaborative thinking. Students also participate in weekly one-on-one meetings to receive in-depth research feedback. All lab members are expected to actively engage in the full research cycle and aim to publish their work in top-tier conferences and journals in HCI, AI, or related fields.

##### Above all, we value a lab culture that encourages students to be responsible, hardworking, and warm-hearted, supporting one another with both intellectual rigor and kindness.

### For Prospective Interns and Graduate Students

Before joining our lab, we expect applicants to have demonstrated experience in at least three to four of the following core research skills for Human-AI Interaction research:
* User research

* Desk research

* Qualitative analysis

* Interaction design

* Prototyping

* AI prototyping literacy

* Technical fluency with AI/ML systems

* Usability & UX evaluation

* Quantitative analysis

* Data visualization

* Academic writing

* Academic presentation

If you're still building these skills, we recommend taking hands-on HCI or AI courses, or practicing independently through prototyping, coding, or user research. We value your initiative, curiosity, and willingness to learn.
